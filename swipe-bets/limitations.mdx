## Technical limitations

### Mobile-only interface

Swipe Bets is designed exclusively for mobile devices. The card-based swipe interface is not optimized for desktop use.

### WebSocket dependency

The feature requires an active WebSocket connection. If the connection fails or is unavailable, cards cannot be enriched with real-time data and will not display.

### Single bet at a time

Only one bet can be processed simultaneously. Users must wait for the current bet to complete before placing another.

### Maximum retry limit

Bet placement retries are limited to 5 attempts. After 5 failed retries, the bet is marked as failed.

### Card enrichment failures

Cards that cannot be enriched (missing tournament, event, or market data) are automatically filtered out and not displayed to users.

## Data limitations

### Recommendation staleness

Recommendations are fetched in batches of 100. If odds change significantly between fetch and display, users may see outdated information until the card is enriched via WebSocket.

### Excluded IDs growth

The `excludeIds` array grows indefinitely in localStorage. Very active users may eventually hit localStorage size limits (typically 5-10MB).

### Pagination boundaries

When reaching the last page of recommendations, no new cards will load. Users must refresh or change filters to get new recommendations.

## User experience limitations

### No bet editing

Once a swipe gesture is initiated, the bet cannot be edited or cancelled. Users must wait for the bet to complete.

### Single undo

Only the last skipped card can be returned. Users cannot undo multiple swipes or return bet cards.

### Tutorial requirement

First-time users must complete the tutorial and set a bet amount before accessing the main interface. This cannot be skipped.

### Balance updates

Balance updates occur after bet completion. During bet processing, the displayed balance may not reflect pending bets.

## Performance considerations

### Memory usage

Maintaining WebSocket subscriptions for multiple entities can increase memory usage. The system limits visible cards to 3 to mitigate this.

### Animation performance

Complex animations may cause performance issues on low-end devices. Animation duration is fixed and cannot be adjusted.

### Network dependency

The feature requires stable network connectivity. Poor connections may cause delays in bet placement or card loading.

## Browser compatibility

### LocalStorage requirement

The feature requires localStorage support. Private browsing modes that disable localStorage will cause issues with state persistence.

### Motion support

Card animations use Framer Motion. Browsers without modern CSS transform support may experience degraded animations.

### Touch events

Swipe gestures require touch event support. Desktop browsers without touch simulation may have limited functionality.

## Known issues

### Race conditions

Rapid swiping can occasionally cause race conditions in card loading. The system includes locks to prevent this, but edge cases may occur.

### WebSocket reconnection

If the WebSocket connection drops and reconnects, subscriptions must be re-established. This may cause a brief delay in data updates.

### Timezone handling

Event times are displayed in the user's local timezone. Users in different timezones may see different times for the same event.

## Important notes

### Analytics tracking

All bet placements are tracked with `currentBetType: 'swipe_bet'`. Ensure analytics systems are configured to handle this bet type.

### Currency precision

Bet amounts must respect currency precision settings. Amounts with too many decimal places will be truncated.

### Market closure

Markets can close while a card is visible. The system checks market status before bet placement, but there's a small window where a market may close between check and placement.

### Coefficient changes

Odds can change during bet processing. The system accepts coefficient changes by default (`accept_changes: true`).

### Error messages

Error messages are localized. Ensure translation keys exist for all error codes used by the feature.

### PostMessage events

The feature sends postMessage events for partner integration. Ensure parent frames are configured to receive these events if needed.

### Subscription cleanup

WebSocket subscriptions are cleaned up when cards change. However, if the component unmounts unexpectedly, subscriptions may persist until the next page load.
